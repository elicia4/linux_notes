# `sudo`

Notes taken on [this video](https://youtu.be/07JOqKOBRnU) and other resources.

[***Table of Contents***](/README.md)  

There are many commands that you can only use with root priveleges. `sudo` is
something you can use instead of root. If, for instance, you were logged in as a
local user and wanted to update your system with `apt update`, you wouldn't be
able to do it. 

To change to another account (root by default):

```bash
su - [user]
```

Note that not all systems have the root account enabled. But you can get by by
not using the root account at all by using `sudo`, if you have it properly set
up you can lock root out. You shouldn't have the root account enabled for `ssh`
login.

To execute a command as the superuser without starting a new interactive shell:

```bash
su -c 'ls -l /root/*'
```

Always use apostrophes (**\'\'**) with this command.

To find out if you have `sudo` installed:

```bash
which sudo
```

Find out what your `sudo` group is on your distribution. Usually it's named
`sudo` or `wheel`. The `sudoers` file contains that information:

```bash
# if you don't have sudo set up, you will have to switch to root
su -
cat /etc/passwd

# if sudo already exists on your system
sudo cat /etc/passwd
```

Find the following lines in the config:

```bash
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any commands
%sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

It can be `wheel` instead of `sudo`.

To add a user to the `sudo` group:

```bash
usermod -aG sudo user
```

To view groups of a local user account:

```bash
groups
```

To see which permissions you have access to:

```bash
sudo -l
```

If you have 3 `ALL`'s, you have permission to do anything.

What do you do when you forget to use `sudo` all he time? Start using:

```bash
# !! represents your last command
sudo !!
```

Now let's take a look at the `/etc/sudoers` file. There are configurations for
the root user and various `sudo` groups. You can create a new group that has
access to sudo by copying the `%sudo ...` line and changing the name from `sudo`
to something else.

What do the `ALL`'s mean? 
- The first `ALL` refers to the host/server that you are allowed to execute the
commands on. 
- The `ALL`'s in parentheses pertain to the users that have access to execute
commands, by default `sudo` impersonates `root`. 
- The first `ALL` refers to the user you're allowed to impersonate, the 
second refers to the group, the last refers to the commands a user is allowed to
use with `sudo`.

Note that you shouldn't edit the file with a "normal" editor, you can break the
strict formatting and lock yourself out of using the server. There's a special
command that allows you to edit the file:

```bash
sudo visudo 
```

Add a new line to the `User privilege specification`:

```bash
user   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

Now save and exit the file, it you made any mistakes, `visudo` will tell you :)

You can create a `user` account if you don't have it already:

```bash
sudo adduser user
```

To switch to `user`:

```bash
sudo su - user
```

Again, to see what it can do:

```bash
sudo -l
```

...but you want to be more restrictive with `sudo`. Let's restrict `user` to be
able to do one specific thing:

```bash
user   ALL=(ALL:ALL) /usr/bin/apt
```

If you run `apt` now from the `user` account, it will work, but other commands,
like `reboot`, won't. You can add other commands like so:

```bash
user   ALL=(ALL:ALL) /usr/bin/apt,/usr/bin/rm
```

You can set up `sudo` to not need a password:

```bash
user   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt,/usr/bin/rm
```

Note that this lowers your security. 

If you make a mistake, you will be prompted with:

```bash
>>> /etc/sudoers: syntax error near line 21 <<<
What now?
```

It doesn't tell you what exactly to do. 

- to edit the file, enter `e`. 
- to exit without saving changes, enter `x`.
- to save the changes **with the mistakes** (never really do this), enter `q`.

These are the basics :)
