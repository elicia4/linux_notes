# Using Public-Private Keys

[***Table of Contents***](./README.md)  

SSH keys allow you even greater security and convenience. To connect to a
server you have to type the password. 

OpenSSH is very secure, but if your password is weak an attacker will easily
get into your server. It would be a lot better without passwords at all, *SSH
keys* allow you to avoid typing the password and use a key to connect.

If you fail the key or don't have the key, it will still ask you for the
password. You should disable password authentication, disabling passwords and
using SSH keys is the recommended security approach. This way any sort of
password guessing is out of the question. If you don't have the key, you can't
get in!

You can generate a brand new key, make sure you don't already have a key in the
directory you want to create your key:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

If you do have the key in the directory already, it will be overwritten and you
might lose access to some server. Then enter in the *passphrase*. It is very
important, you might think it's defeating the purpose of having a key, but the
passphrase is just another added layer of security that makes it so you need to
know that passphrase to begin using that key, and that passphrase is something
you type locally, not on the server end, which means if someone steals that key
they won't be able to use it. *Always use it*.

Enter the passphrase again, now you have two files: `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`,
the key fingerprint and the key's randomart image. NEVER LEAK THE PRIVATE KEY
(`id_rsa`), you can show the *public* key (`id_rsa.pub`) wherever you want. 

To actually use the keys you will have to copy the public key to the
remote server. Manually copy the public key:

```bash
cat id_rsa.pub 
```

Or if you have `xclip`:

```bash
xclip -sel clip <public_key_name>
```

Then `ssh` into your server. Create the `.ssh` directory if it doesn't exist.
Create an `authorized_keys` file inside it and paste the key in it:

```bash
mkdir .ssh; cd .ssh
vim authorized_keys
```

Relog into the server. You didn't have to put in the password! The server
checked your *local private key* against the server's public key and
mathematically linked them. If they are a successful match, you will be
connected. This is why it's not a problem to leak out the public key. The
connection is verified against a private key, which stays *with you* and stays
secret. To see exactly what happenes when you connect:

```bash
ssh -v <server>
```

On Ubuntu Desktop, you can check the box to always use the passphrase to unlock
the key every time you log in.

`ssh-copy-id` is an easy way to add a key to the remote server:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <server>
```

It enables login with a key on a remote server. It adds the keys by appending
them to the remote user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file (creating the file &
directory if necessary).

The `-i` parameter is for input file.
