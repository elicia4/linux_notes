# Configuring SSH Server

[***Table of Contents***](./README.md)  

You have to have the ssh server component running, to see if you have the
server binary:

```bash
which sshd
```

The `sshd` binary represents the server. `sshd` means *ssh daemon*. Check its
status:

```bash
systemctl status sshd
```

Note that Ubuntu and Debian call the service `ssh`, not `sshd`. 

You can use all `systemctl` commands to manage the service. `restart`, `stop`,
do whatever you want. When you stop the `sshd` service it's not going to
terminate any existing connections. But if you disconnect, you won't
be able to reconnect since the `sshd` service has to be running in order to
establish new connections. To `start` and `enable` the service at the same
time:

```bash
systemctl enable --now sshd 
```

Take a look at the `/etc/ssh` directory. There are keys there stored for the 
fingerprints. When you copy server images, ssh keys are copied along with them,
and you don't want all your servers to have the same ssh keys. *Make sure to
regenerate them*. 

The config you care about is `sshd_config`:

```bash
vim sshd_config
```

To change the default port, change the `Port` value, to `2222` for example.

You should disable root login, change `PermitRootLogin` to `no`. (!!!) You ONLY
want to set it to `no` if you have another user you can log in with via `ssh`
outside of root. Root is going to be tried by anyone.

`PasswordAuthentication` is the most important security configuration change
that you can possibly make with the ssh-server and EVERYBODY should set this to
`no`. (!!!) You should only set this to `no` if you have an ssh key
relationship already set up, you wanna make sure that you log in with your ssh
key BEFORE you set this to `no`. 

It's also recommended to disable some more settings to completely disable
password authentication. The final config should contain the following
settings:

```bash
# `KbdInteractiveAuthentication` disables keyboard-interactive authentication.
# `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` is a deprecated alias for this.
# I would use `ChallengeResponseAuthentication no` anyway.
# KbdInteractiveAuthentication no # modern version
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no 

# disable password authentication
PasswordAuthentication no

# disable PAM. If set to yes this will enable PAM authentication using
# ChallengeResponseAuthentication and PasswordAuthentication in addition to PAM
# account and session module processing for all authentication types. 
# 
# If you want PAM, keep it enabled, `PasswordAuthentication no` should disable 
# password authentication for it. See `man sshd_config` for details.
UsePAM no

# disable root login
PermitRootLogin no
```

After configuration, restart the service and make sure the restart didn't
fail:

```bash
systemctl restart sshd
systemctl status sshd
```

Test the configuration change and make sure that ssh still works. You will
reconnect to it with the server's new settings. To connect with a different
port:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 <server>
```

If you don't include the `-p` option it will assume **22**.

The port change will not work on newer versions of Ubuntu, to make it work,
refer to [https://askubuntu.com/a/1439482](https://askubuntu.com/a/1439482). In
short:

> Port and ListenAddress options are not used when sshd is socket-activated,
> which is now the default in Ubuntu. See sshd_config(5) and
> /usr/share/doc/openssh-server/README.Debian.gz for details.

To change the default port, you can turn off `ssh.socket` and the `sshd_config`
will work again with `Ports` and `Addressing` settings:

```bash
systemctl disable --now ssh.socket
systemctl restart ssh.service
```

Changing your port number to something other than 22 makes your server more
secure. There are bots that look for open 22 ports, when they find one they try
to get in. Your server will be spared :) Since `PasswordAuthentication` is 
disabled, password attacks are out of the question as well.

[Also note that](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/727500):

> Ubuntu/Debian distributions have the non-standard entry Include
> /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf at the beginning of the distribution
> sshd_config. The purpose of this is to allow users to customize their sshd
> configuration without modifying the core sshd_config file, which can minimize
> conflicts or unexpected configuration changes on apt update of OpenSSH.
